## About

**What's a Gamebook?**

In short, a Gamebook is an interactive story read in a non-linear order that is given by choices made by player, the reader.

Gamebooks consist of sections, each of which contains a part of the story and usually some choices. Once player makes a choice, he continues by reading the next section associated with the choice they made.

The goal is then to reach the ending of the story by selecting the correct choices (a good one, hopefully).

**What was Adventure Call FX created in?**

**Language**: Java 8  
**GUI**: JavaFX + SceneBuilder

**What's up with the name?**

Adventure Call refers to a [sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdQ11fTRpCg) from the excellent Limmy's Show.  
FX then simply refers to JavaFX.
