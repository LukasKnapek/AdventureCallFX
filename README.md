## About

**What's a Gamebook?**

In short, a Gamebook is an interactive story read in a non-linear order that is given by choices made by player, the reader.

Gamebooks consist of sections, each of which contains a part of the story and usually some choices. Once player makes a choice, he continues by reading the next section associated with the choice they made.

The goal is to reach an ending of the story (the good one, hopefully) by picking the right choices.

**What was Adventure Call FX created in?**

**What's up with the name?**
